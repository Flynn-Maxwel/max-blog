    <h2>Journey into AI</h2>
    <p><em>Published on May 4, 2025</em></p>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence has fascinated me ever since I first learned about it in my computer science classes. From self-driving cars to virtual assistants, AI is revolutionizing every field.</p>
    <p>In my academic journey, I’ve been exploring the intersection of AI and Internet of Things (IoT). Currently, I’m working on a project to create an AI-powered mood-based lighting and music system. The goal is to build a smart home experience that adapts to the user's mood in real-time.</p>
    <p>It’s challenging but also incredibly rewarding. I believe AI has the potential to change the world, and I’m excited to be part of that transformation. Stay tuned for updates on my AI projects!</p>
